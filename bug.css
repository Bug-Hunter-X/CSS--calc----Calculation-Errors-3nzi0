The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations, but sometimes it can lead to unexpected results due to incorrect usage of units or operator precedence.  For example, using `calc(100% - 10px)` in a situation where the parent element doesn't have a defined width could lead to an unexpected layout because the calculation depends on the parent's width, which is undefined.
